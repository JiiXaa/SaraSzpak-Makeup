# Sara Szpak Make-Up Artist and Hair Stylist

## About

**Sara's Szpak** B2C website showcasing an award-winning Make-Up Artist and Hair Stylist business located in Newport - Wales. Sara Szpak specialises in bridal makeup, hair design and creative makeovers for commercial photoshoots and also provides private make-up 1-1 lessons.

I have designed the website to look professional with a weeding colour scheme as it is the main focus of the business. It is designed to be fully responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential and existing customers.

The goal of the website is to provide an up-to-date pictures portfolio (bridal make-up, bridal hairstyles and creative makeovers), information about the services it delivers, and also allow an easy way for getting in touch with the business owner.

The site must meet all the requirements and goals as potential visitors will most likely be comparing other similar local services, so the final website look must stand out and show everything the user would want to see.
