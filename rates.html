            <p>
              A trial is highly recommended so that we can discuss your ideas
              and create the perfect look. This alleviates any last minute
              stress and guarantees that we have the same beautiful look in
              mind. As your private & personal makeup artist, I will work with
              you to ensure that your vision becomes a reality.
